# ProjectEuler

This project was based on the Project Euler coding challenges found at www.projecteuler.net/. The aim of this was to apply my skills in HTML and CSS to create an interactive website whilst also developing my skills in JavaScript by solving the various challenges.

N.B This project includes code solutions to some of the first few challenges, but not the direct answer. Please do not look at the code if you plan to work out these puzzles by yourself.

Thanks.
